### Key Insights
- Poor water quality (high turbidity, E. coli contamination, high nitrate levels) is strongly linked to waterborne diseases like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea.

- Early prediction can help target interventions before outbreaks escalate.

- Integrating water quality, disease records, and geospatial data enables effective, real-time health surveillance.

- Seasonal trends and regional differences (urban slum vs. rural vs. coastal) play a significant role in outbreak patterns.

### Objectives
1. Predictive Goal: Estimate the total number of waterborne disease cases in a community using water quality and location data.

2. Classification Goal: Categorize communities into High, Medium, or Low risk levels.

3. Public Health Impact: Enable timely, targeted interventions to reduce disease spread.

4. Policy Support: Provide actionable insights for NGOs, health ministries, and WASH programs.

### Process / Workflow

1.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Convert dates to datetime format

Scale numerical features (optional for some models)

Feature engineering:

Total_Waterborne_Cases = Cholera + Typhoid + Diarrhea

Time-based features (month, quarter)

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Time trends by region

Correlation between water quality metrics and disease counts

Seasonal pattern analysis (rainy vs. dry season)

Spatial risk visualization

Identify highest-risk countries/communities

3.Modeling

Regression (Primary Task): Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, LSTM (optional)

Classification (Secondary Task): Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier

4.Model Evaluation

Regression: MAE, RMSE, R² Score

Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

5.Deployment

Interactive dashboard ( Power BI) for trends, heatmaps, and predictions

Email notifier to alert health authorities of high-risk communities in real time
